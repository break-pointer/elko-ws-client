ElkoEP OpenHAB Web-Service Listener
===================================

This small WS Client listens to changes on ElkoEP Control Unit (e.g. eLAN-RF-003)
and sends updates to OpenHAB items.

This allows ElkoEP device's state changes to be populated to OpenHAB server in case
the state was changed from the outside, e.g. with RFWB-20/G.

The script expects config.json to be present. Please check config.json.dist to start.
